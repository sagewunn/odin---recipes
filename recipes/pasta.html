        <h3>Ingredients -</h3>

        <ul>

            <li> 6 tbsp olive oil </li>
            <li> 2 cloves garlic (minced) </li>

            <li> 1 3/4 grated Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
           
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti. </li>
